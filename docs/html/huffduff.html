<CENTER><B>Abstract</B> <B>HF/DF An Allied Weapon against German U-Boats 1939-1945</B></CENTER> Radio communication influenced WW II much more than was realised by the early post war historians and by the general public. For example, after 1974 ULTRA became common knowledge yet, even today, some aspects still remain secret. Likewise, though HF/DF (huff-duff) was known about, the understanding of its technology remains limited. It is quite likely that this is due to the strict secrecy practised by the British authorities. It even happened that, in the 1960's, after Derek Wellman offered BBC TV a play concerning his experience as a wartime huff-duff operator, a call came advising him that "this subject is not of interest to the British people"!! The aim of this paper is to explain, briefly, some aspects of HF/DF so as to create a greater understanding of its technology and the circumstances surrounding its use. After all, it could be associated either directly or indirectly with the sinking of an estimated 24 % of all U-Boats lost during WW II. � Arthur O. Bauer Diemen, The Netherlands Stgcdv&t@xs4all.nl 27 December 2004 <CENTER><B>HF/DF an Allied weapon against German U-boats 1939 - 1945 Introduction</B></CENTER> During the First World War the German U-boats played an important role. The main aim of the U-boat High Command was to cut off the Allied life line. The fact that the United States gave up their initial relatively neutral stance and joined the Allies has to be ascribed above all to the so-called unrestricted U-boat war fought by the Germans. As one knows, the British were able (very cleverly) to persuade the USA to come into the war before the end of 1917. Though this is not the place to examine in detail how this came about! The First World War showed how vulnerable the supply lines between the USA and Great Britain are. In the Second World War there too was a moment when the shipping losses became unbearable and the cancellation of convoys across the Atlantic was a distinct possibility as the shipyards could no longer make good the losses of tonnage. Building a ship just takes longer than its torpedoing. The course of history is rarely determined by one factor or cause alone and that was naturally no different in the two world wars. Nonetheless, individual events or circumstances sometimes exercise a great influence on the way things work out. <B>Some aspects of "Direction Finding", a well known technology</B> Famous names appear when we look back into the historical sequence of inventions which lead to the design of modern direction finding apparatus. In my opinion, one of the most important was the invention, by E. Bellini and A. Tosi, in 1907 of the radiogoniometer, which became known as Bellini - Tosi or the so-called B-T goniometer. After about 1915, i.e. after the sensitivity of receivers became more adequate, B-T became very popular and has been widely used since. (Keen, p. 156 - 201, et al.) Figure 1: The goniometer principle of Bellini-Tosi It can easily be understood from this line drawing that two wire loop aerials are fed onto two field coils. These coils are mounted so as to be at right angles. It is known that the induced magnetic field lines do not then (theoretically) affect each other. Their real invention was to introduce a search coil, which acts as a magnetic flux pick-up device. It is evident that when a particular E.M. (Electro Magnetic) wave induces an electrical current in one or both loops this subsequently results in an electrical current in the goniometer circuit. It can be understood that this produces a magnetic flux pattern which is due to the arriving E.M. wave. With shore based DF antennas the search coil zero setting was usually related to the direction of an antenna loop which picked up the maximum field strength from a specified source or direction. Shore based antennas were (are), quite often lined up North- South and East-West. For ship board antennas relationship tended to refer to Fore - Aft and Port - Starboard. It can be proved that only the magnetic field component H of an E.M. wave can induce an antenna loop current when its perimeter is < 3 λ (wave length). Sense antennas commonly function on the electrical or E field component of E.M. waves. As we know each antenna loop in fig. 1 is delivering its appropriate current onto its connected field coil, hence the magnetic field distribution is equivalent to that of the induced loop currents. Although I am not going to prove it here, we can easily explain this principle by assuming that an incident E.M. wave reaches the antenna system under an angle of 45 degrees parallel to the horizontal plane, and this subsequently results in equal currents in both loop circuits. If we bring the cylindrical axis of the search coil parallel to that of one of the field coils, only half of the induced antenna power can be picked up by it. Only when the cylindrical axis of the search coil is brought into line with the arriving E.M. wave (hence in our assumption the bearing angle P = 45�) can the optimal power transfer occur. What happens if we rotate the search coil through 180�? Again a flux (signal) maximum will be picked up. Hence it is impossible, by means of such B-T goniometer only, to determine from which direction the arriving E.M. wave is approaching, is it from 45� or 225�? Therefore a sense antenna has to be incorporated and its signal will create, by vector summation, a cardioid radiation pattern (which I do not intend to discuss further). We will look briefly at the origin of B-T vector summation. ............................(article continues) For this explanation we will ignore the coupling deviations (errors) of this goniometer type, because these are of a systematical order and do not influence the fundamentals of DF by means of a B-T goniometer. The HF/DF type FH 3 utilised the manually controlled B-T goniometer in conjunction with the Navy type B 21 B receiver. This latter system proved to be the backbone of huff-duff against the U-boat threat, on board most escort vessels. For instance, even during the zenith of the Battle of the Atlantic (during the early days of May 1943) of seven escorting convoy ships of ONS 5 only HMS Duncan was equipped with a FH 4. (ADM 237/113, and Bauer, p. 150) Not until the second half of 1944 did the FH 3 apparatus became surpassed by its famous successor the FH 4, which will be introduced hereafter. Watson-Watt and Herd designed for the Radio Research Board in 1926 their twin channel receiver, which was originally designed to detect the direction of thunderstorms and consequently was not required to be, for this purpose, very sensitive. This type of direction finder became well known as: - Watson-Watt, or Twin Path C.R.D.F., receiver system. It is fairly clear that the twin channel indicator in figure 3 has some similarity with Bellini- Tosi's invention. The field coils are replaced by the X and Y deflection plates of a CRT. The indication of the E.M. wave direction (bearing) now appeared automatically, when appropriate deflection voltage were induced between the appropriate deflection plates. In some way we can understand that according to Keen (p. 159) this apparatus was described as an "Electrostatic Radiogoniometer". The major advantage of this invention is its instant bearing indication, without any man made delay. In other words, the search coil was "quasi replaced" by an electronic beam which painted a Lissajous figure on the indicator screen of a CRT, and whose amplitude was proportional to the resulting vector pointer after summation of the two field components. Only when an E.M. wave is exactly in line with one loop, and thus causes only one deflection to be fed with electrical energy, no vector summation occurs. Therefore one sees only a straight vertical- or horizontal-line on the CRT. .........................(article continues) For this explanation we will ignore the coupling deviations (errors) of this goniometer type, because these are of a systematical order and do not influence the fundamentals of DF by means of a B-T goniometer.

Redgment, and in the US, by Kathleen Broome Williams, et al. DF on shortwave was already well known and widely used by shore DF stations before WW II. The main problem is to overcome the distinct shortcomings of antenna loops (aerials), which caused more or less severe bearing deviations (errors) especially on board ships. The best antenna system for DF on shortwave proved to be the well known Adcock antenna, although this antenna type has some disadvantages when it is used for DF of ground waves. Adcock antennas need a very strictly controlled linear antenna site (plain and flat instrata with uniform conductivity), which can hardly be obtained on board ships due to discontinuities which are caused by the superstructure of ships. Due to this hampering antenna behaviour the opinio communis was that accurate DF on shortwave could never be made fully operational on board ships of any kind. One of the main DF problems which is faced on board ships is caused by the more or less erratic behaviour of fields re-radiated originated by the superstructure of ships, for instance, by ship masts - the bridge and pipes - (which proved to be excellent re-radiators when these are excited by E.M. waves in respect to n A 3 λ) etc.. The relatively high Q-factor of these reradiators can often cause an equal or even higher signal input at the front-end of a DF receiver than that which is induced, in the antenna system, by the arriving E.M. wave! As we have seen before, this could cause severe bearing errors which could reach 20� or more. This phenomenon was well known in those days, but the question arose as to how could this be countered and/or controlled? It soon proved that a DF antenna positioned (mounted) at the top of the tallest mast in the ship was the most favourable site. <IEE Proceeding, p. 798> In my opinion it was the Polish engineer Struszynski - working at ASE - who was the "pater intellectualis" of a team which solved this problem. Both the PS and FA loop can clearly be noticed, in figure 5 on the next page, on top of the central chamber. Struszynski designed, among other things, the particular coupling transformers which linked the symmetrical coaxial antenna cables either on to the B-T goniometer of the FH 3 or on to the front-end of the FH 4 receiver. These RF transformers have a very low stray field effect and are electrostatically shielded so as to prevent capacitive coupling (stray pick-up) between the primary and secondary windings. It is evident that these transformers were matched to the terminating impedance of the antenna circuits. Each set of transformers had individually to be matched for equal electrical parameters. Separating the direct antenna loop currents from the front-end of the receiver, as well as the careful symmetrical wiring of the coaxial cable circuit, enhanced the common mode rejection of the system up to about 100 dB at 1 MHz. It can be seen that energy induced in a symmetrical coaxial cable by a stray field will be picked up by both conductors at the same time thus cancelling out any effects at the secondary circuit of the transformer. (IEE p.825) Even the radio hut and all its entering cables had to be electrically shielded and filtered so as to prevent any stray fields from being picked up by the receiver itself. Figure 5: The FH 4 antenna circuit The coaxial cables (so-called: twin-core feeder cables) used in these DF systems had to be all from the same production lot (same cable reel) and their mutual difference in cable length had to be kept within a maximum of 1 inch, so as to prevent unacceptable phase errors! As we have noticed, the re-radiation field of the resonating antenna mast could be of severe proportions and such fields would be picked-up by the sense aerial too! Struszynski's team again solved this problem by balancing - for RF - the sense aerial circuit against the mounting mast by means of an adjustable electronic bridge circuit. (Redgment, p. 239) "The antenna" The RN sailors called this antenna the "birdcage", though how it worked electrically was kept a secret for many years. This secrecy was aided by it's very complex construction. Figure 6: The FH 4 antenna in detail The previous line drawing shows its well known antenna profile. Even with explanation this figure is not easy to understand and gives no immediate clue as to how smart the design was. Figure 7: The PS loop The line drawing above shows the broadside view of the PS antenna loop and the edge-on view of the FA loop. Figure 8: The sense antenna Shown here is the sense aerial on top of the central chamber (see fig. 6), the aerial is facing upwards. Downwards we see the counterpoise, which provides an artificial ground. To extend the counterpoise the rods are folded upwards as well. I am not sure whether they also serve the additional purpose of screening off the re-radiated fields which are arriving from lower elevations. Figure 9: The reinforcement rods It is evident that the previously shown extended counterpoise could not be kept structurally stable. Therefore, reinforcement rods were introduced to stiffen this complex antenna construction. For stable and precise operation this was a real must, certainly when one realises the nature of the environmental conditions in which it had to perform! <B>Watson-Watt type DF receiver</B> The early design of the "twin-channel" receiver type R.L.135 and R.L.66A had already been done by the Plessy Co. Ltd. in 1940; though it took quite some time before the first operational FH 4 apparatus became available for the RN in 1943. The early type used a set of 5 interchangeable coil boxes, which were stored in a (hanging) box to the left and right of the receiver and which covered a frequency range between 1- 25 MHz. Its successor FH 4 Mark IV was equipped with switched coils which covered 4 frequencies ranges between 1 - 24 MHz. (manual FH 4, chapter 2, p. 8, Bauer, p. 101 - 109, 133 -139). Figure 10: Blockdiagram of the FH 4 receiver This blockdiagram explains the principle of the twin-channel HF/DF type FH 4. As we will see hereafter, the FA and PS channels were "carbon copies" to ensure that signal delay for both channels was kept (theoretically) equal. Only one local oscillator needed to be utilised, whose signal was fed to both mixers simultaneously. Figure 11: Principle diagram of the FH 4 receiver Shown here is the basic circuit diagram of the FH 4, which we will discuss briefly. Let us first focus on the main FA and PS receiver channels. The two loops are linked via the transformers T2 (designed by Struszynski) on to the input bandfilter at the front-end of the receiver, followed by the RF amplifier stage V1 to the mixer (Frequency Changer) valve V2 . The common local oscillator (F.C. oscillator) is generated by valve V3 and fed simultaneously to the mixers V2. After passing three IF stages V4 - V6 both signals are fed to the CRT deflection plates. The bearing display is similar to that shown in figure 3. We have seen, already, that a B-T goniometer itself always indicates a bearing which could be at + or - 180�. This ambiguity can be solved by the introduction of a third (sense) signal which phase-quadrature is relative - positive or negative - with respect to the fields induced in the antenna loop. It is obvious that it had to be amplified equally as both loop signals, and that any time delay deviation of the signal phase had to be prevented. Inevitably, a third equal receiver channel had to be incorporated in the receiver to accommodate the sense signal. But this could hardly be managed in the available room left in the receiver. In my opinion a smart, though "poor man's", solution was chosen to overcome this limitation. Figure 12: Blockdiagram of the FH 4, used in sense mode The sense signal was fed to one of the receiver channels after the accompanying loop signal was disconnected. At the same time the accompanying IF output which is connected with the deflection plates of the CRT is disconnected from it and these plates are now electrically connected to ground. The IF signal is then fed, via the sense limiter, to the Wehnelt cylinder, so as to control the beam current of the CRT in such a manner that, without signal, its beam current was cut-off (blocking) and only when a sufficient signal was received could a trace be observed on the CRT screen. Let us look, on the next page, at the principle involved (disregard phase difference between the signals). 1. the FA loop and its radiation pattern in respect to an arriving E.M. wave. 2. the typical circular radiation pattern of a sense aerial 3. the CRT; its Y deflection system is fed by the accompanying output of the IF strip and the X deflection plates are connected to ground. 4- 5. the upper sinusoid is representing the output of the IF strip. The lower sinusoid is re ceived by the sense channel and fed in an appropriate manner onto the Wehnelt cylinder. The time span which coincides with the positive half cycle (0� - 180�) of the sense signal is used to de-block the Wehnelt cylinder of the CRT. (often called "control grid", which is, in technical means, not correctly) ..................................(article continues) Let us refer back to figure 11 and concentrate first on the test oscillator section. In the centre of it we notice that the mixer valve V9 has a multiple function. The triode section is used as a BFO generator, whose signal is fed onto the detector stage so as to interfere in a regular manner with the IF signal. A certain amount of energy is picked up from the local oscillator valve V3 via C2, which is then followed by a separator stage V8 and fed onto the mixer section of valve V9. Let us assume that the test signal is activated by the appropriate settings of switch 7. The BFO signal is then disconnected from the IF stage and fed - via IF rejection filters - onto V10 which amplifies and probably also separates the test loop circuit from this mixer stage. If the BFO setting is adjusted correctly the test oscillator frequency will always be exactly identical to that to which the receiver is tuned. A third signal is generated in the test oscillator unit. This RF signal was used to ensure that the receiver channels could be adjusted properly for their mutual amplification factor as well as for mutual signal phase. To carry out this alignment, the first step was to switch on the so-called comparator mode (S2 - S3 ). Both receiver channels were thus connected onto the same signal source. When amplification and signal phase were matched properly, a straight line was observed between 45� and 225�, which is in Navy terms equal to 45� and 135�. When, for instance, the phase tuning is incorrect an ellipsoid is shown with all its implications as we have already discussed. After this foregoing alignment (set up) the test loop was switched on. (S2 and S3 are opened again) Figure14: Test loop of the FH 4 antenna Shown is here the test loop, which is mounted in the central axis of the DF antenna. Generally speaking, if we see somewhere a "Birdcage" antenna without a test loop it is certainly in used with a FH 3 installation. Only when a test loop is utilised is the receiver concerned an FH 4 apparatus. I do not know if its successor the FH 5 used such a test facility as well because, today, this information is still kept classified (some ships are still equipped with this installation). The main function of such a test loop is to check the mutual (amplification and) signal phase of the two RF stages of the receiver which can be controlled by trimmer CT1 (fig. 11) on the front panel (whilst, of course, watching the display on the CRT). Up until now, we still don't exactly know what made this equipment so outstanding because, if we neglect its antenna circuit, all the rest was certainly common knowledge for the Germans also in those days. Watson-Watt type direction finders had been in wide use since the end of the 1920s. <B>Radiation patterns of the FH3/4 antenna</B> As we have already noticed, the superstructures of ships can cause all sorts of bearing deviations. We will discuss this phenomenon for some sample frequencies, though it has to be noticed that a frequency change of, for example, only 10 kHz can cause radiation patterns to be changed in an erratic manner. Due to this phenomenon, interpolation between curves is not possible and a calibration curve is needed for every frequency that is likely to be used in the operation of the installation. (IEE, p. 810) How then can acceptable bearings be achieved within deviation limits of between 3 to 5 degrees? Many deviations are of a systematic nature and are widely dependant upon the superstructure of a ship. But systematic deviations lend themselves to be compensated for by means of a calibration curve and this proved to be the solution to this problem! The Germans call this technique "Funkbeschickung" and its technology was already widely used in the 1930s for medium and long wave DF systems. For each possible frequency a calibration chart had to be prepared, which would hardly be managed when we realise that German U-boats on the northern (western) hemisphere used frequencies in the range 3.7 - 15 MHz. Thus, a frequency band of . 11 MHz had to be covered. If we further assume that a calibration had to be made for every 20 kHz then more than 500 curves (theoretically) had to be prepared for each ship equipped with HF/DF! It has to be realised too, that the so-called "Penang" boats (also called "monsoon boats"), sailing to the Far East, were communicating on frequencies up to 24 MHz. <B>A calibration procedure was carried out as follows:-</B> Each ship had to be anchored on a buoy such that a calibration vessel could circle it with constant radius and which sent bearing signals at a distance of approximately one mile from all directions and, at the same time, all vessels had to be far enough from shore to avoid any DF aberrations resulting from land effects. At every 5� of azimuth - "blurring" percentage, bearing deviations and the quality of sense indication had to be logged. The bearing accuracy was visually checked by optical means. Consequently, this vessel had to stop for each calibration step 71 times for one circle. Thus, if we assume that such a calibration vessel had to sail 500 times around the ship under calibration the task would seem impossible and could hardly be managed, in my opinion. (500 x 71 = 35500 steps!) But, it was the Germans themselves who made what seems to be impossible nevertheless become possible! According to PRO document ADM 220/69 dated 3 July 1943 - which considered a list (for the calibration officers concerned) of the frequencies for which the HF/DF systems had to be calibrated for the Atlantic and Arctic areas - only 44 frequencies which were expected to be utilised! Though, we always have to consider that such details only exposure a certain momentum. (For more details see Bauer, p. 16 - 20) True bearings by means of the FH 4 and its correction curves. Figure 16: FH 4 bearing error compenstation, by means of correction curves Shown here are the main attributes which had to be used to assure more or less accurate bearings by means of HF/DF. For each frequency separate bearing curves had to be prepared for Port (Red side) and for Starboard (Green side) of a ship. Let us assume that an arriving E.M. wave induces an antenna current and a bearing trace becomes visible on the screen of a CRT. The operator had (after preceding tuning procedures) to rotate a perspex disc which covers the bearing display (CRT) so as to bring the cursor hair line along this trace (which cursor also acts as a bearing memory). We will take, as our example, values of 30� and 150� (respectively) for the green and red curves (these equate to readings of 340� and 160� for the coincident gyro compass readings). The operator's next immediate step was to select the correct "sense" direction. Following this, he had to refer to the calibration curves and he finds that for the Green side curve a bearing deviation correction of - 6 degrees is needed and for the Red side curve a deviation correction of - 5 degrees was required. Hence, dependant on the sense setting, the expected bearing is at: 30� - 6� = 24� or at 150� - 5� = 145�. The blurring curves were mainly used for regular calibration purposes. An interesting aspect is that, although severe bearing deviations occur, the average systematical accuracy still remains within reasonable limits. This phenomenon is well known in statistics and is due to the fact that not all variable deviations are possessed of the same sign, so that not all parameters are varying into the same direction. On this occasion we have not discussed the nature of the U-boat communications and related technical topics. The contents of this paper are essentially a condensation of the five year research work covered, and published, in my book:- "Funkpeilung als alliierte Waffe gegen deutsche U-boote 1939 - 1939" For those who would like to study the subject of HF/DF - I strongly recommend two superb books: Wireless Direction Finding by Keen and Funkpeiltechnik by Grabau and Pfaff. (see ref.) <B>Conclusions </B>In history major technological breakthroughs hardly ever originate due to one circumstance or factor only, but almost always result from a sequence of developments which finally leads to what became known as "the particular solution". Prime examples are, for instance, the development of the atomic bomb, or centimetre radar. HF/DF is, in this respect, no exception. In retrospective let us first look at some technical aspects of "huff-duff". We have noticed that HF/DF had not been invented in Britain, it was a step by step scientific process which started in the early days of this century. Bellini -Tosi's goniometer proved to be of fundamental significance and it became widely used for all sorts of direction finding purposes. We have not discussed the French - American developments which were mainly based upon Busignies work done in Paris in the late 1920s and 1930s, and which were brought to the US on behalf of ITT in late 1940. Kathleen Broome Williams' book contains much detailed information concerning this historical aspect (though, unfortunately, in technical respect here knowledge is too meagre!). Even these HF/DF apparatuses used the B-T principle, although with a spinning search coil. (Keen, p.877-880) It is interesting to note that according to Williams' book, Busignies, also designed a rotating single loop DF apparatus. (also Wireless World, p. 414 - 416) The main problem hampering accurate DF on ships is due to the re-radiated electro magnetic fields which are caused by the superstructure. Re-radiated signals can hardly be avoided under these circumstances. It was Struszynski who solved this major handicap by the introduction of a totally new antenna design, which became known as the "birdcage" antenna. We have noticed how the segments of this antenna were constructed and fit together. Not exactly obvious however is Struszynski's most significant invention: - the RF balancing circuit which - for radio frequencies - separates the top of the mounting ship mast from the sense antenna circuit (which is an inextricable part of the "Birdcage" antenna). Although the Americans claim that they had designed (developed?), during WW II, their own HF/DF antenna. However, I do not know if the Americans have utilised a Struszynski like "RF bridge circuit" to isolate the sense aerial from the ship mast. Though, in my opinion, the US HF/DF antenna design looks less stiff ("a nice weather artefact"). (KBW p. 46 and Henney/Markus p. 155) We have also seen the disadvantages of Watson-Watt's direction finder design and, we have learned about its implications as well. I suppose that this was a choice made by the Royal Navy in the expectation that this type of HF/DF apparatus was the most likely to come into service quickly. Certainly for shore direction finding installations, the AH 6 (which is the shore version of the FH 4) had a great advantage over any chopped or rotating DF (goniometer) apparatus due to the lack of any forced synchronous modulation which could always interfere with the contents of an intercepted wireless signal. I have met Dutch post war FH 4 operators and they told me that this apparatus was rather "unfriendly" to maintain, especially for those who had to align it. It utilised more than 41 tuning facilities, whose alignment had to be checked on a regular basis! According to the manual a set-up alignment could only be carried out after a warming-up period of six hours! Taking all this into consideration then, it is after all, nearly a miracle that this apparatus worked so well and did such a great job! The introduction of calibration charts made correction of bearing errors of a systematic nature possible. We have seen that - due to the unpredictable nature of re-radiated E.M. fields caused by the superstructure of ships - a separate calibration chart had to be prepared for each frequency to be operated. This amounted to a possible provision for more than 500 available frequencies which might have had to be utilised for each ship. Under these circumstances shipborne HF/DF - as were used by the Allies - could never, tactically, have worked at all! All shipborne direction finders allowed for monitoring of only one frequency at the time, in those days. <B><COLOR="Red">To slightly overcome this great disadvantage, the RN utilised a second communication receiver (Navy B 28 B . CR 100) which, at the same time, was tuned onto a different frequency which was expected to be used by the U-boat control as well. (Each HF/DF antenna could be linked - thus wired - onto one receiver only!) Each audio signal was connected onto one earphone section, so as to make monitoring of two different wireless signals at the same time possible.</COLOR></B> This mode was called: split phone operation. It must be said that we were quite lucky that the U-boat wireless signals were nearly always tuned zero beat onto frequencies which were controlled by shore stations and these call signs were quite well known. Hence, huff-duff operators only had to monitor a limited number of frequencies. Although we have not discussed this subject, we have to regard that for certain operations the Germans used so-called "off frequencies" which could operate randomly (from the Allied point of view) - for special services - between plus and minus 300 kHz from a particular centre frequency. Williams shows by an wartime document (p. 201) that, for example, such frequencies had to be watched by a total number of ten monitoring operators at the same time! From an historical point of view, I think it is fair to conclude that: - The role of allied HF/DF is generally undervalued. That this is no merely marginal phenomenon becomes clear when we notice that presumably a quarter (although some sources count this figure to be at a much lower rate) of all U-boat losses can statistically be associated with HF/DF operations during WW II. It is therefore no exaggeration to call radio direction finding a most significant weapon in the war against the U-boats and it undoubtedly influenced Allied warfare to a not inconsiderable extent. Also, that its success owed quite a lot to wrong assessments made by the wireless organisation of the "Kriegsmarine", which kept on utilising zero beat operation for their standard U-boat wireless communications! <B>Acknowledgements</B> I have to thank all who made it finally possible to complete the work of my book, which list contains more than 60 names.

On November 19, 1942, Admiral Noble was replaced as Commander-in-Chief of Western Approaches Command by <B><B>Admiral Sir Max Horton.</B></B> <B><B>Horton used the growing number of escorts becoming available to organize "support groups", to reinforce convoys that came under attack. Unlike the regular escort groups, support groups were not directly responsible for the safety of any particular convoy. This gave them much greater tactical flexibility, allowing them to detach ships to hunt submarines spotted by reconnaissance or picked up by HF/DF.</B></B> Where regular escorts would have to break off and stay with their convoy, the support group ships could keep hunting a U-boat for many hours. One tactic introduced by<B><B> Captain John Walke</B></B>r was the "hold-down", where a group of ships would patrol over a submerged U-boat until its air ran out and it was forced to the surface.

<B><SIZE="3">Building an Intercept Station During World/War II</SIZE></B> Joseph Horn From the late fall of 1942 to the summer of 1943. eleven sailors and I were shipped from Noroton Heights Radio School, Connecticut, to German Morse school at Cheltenham, Maryland, then, to Oppelachia:A.irfield in Florida and on to Bahia. Brazil. Among the twelve ofus shipped to Bahia were~ land Gene Sheck, who are still employed y NSA. How we were selected IS still a mystery because at that time the selectionsystem for assigning personnel leaving Noroton Heights Radio School was not very scientific. Typically, it was: those A-F, standby for submarine duty, all those G-K, standby for cruiser duty, all those L-S, standby for destroyer.duty, all those T-Z, standby for amphibious duty. With that kind of selection process, I have to wonder, still,how they arrived at calling .. Sheck, I I .." to be assigned to USN Station at Cheltenham, Maryland. At that time I was very disappointed about the assignment because 1) I didn't know what was entailed, and 2) I had joined the Navy to go to sea and fight. Whether or not the assignment was proper, I have lived to tell about it. We were sent to Brazil to build an intercept and OF station at Salinas de Margarita-literally, to cut it out of the jungle. <B>Salinas was to be the southern leg of a three station, intercept-and-HF/DF net with control at Recife, Brazil,</B> and the northern station at Belem on the Amazon River. Salinas, about 25 miles by water from the city of Bahia, was located on a peninsula covered with such dense jungle that it was usually considered an island. <B>Our targets were German submarines operating in the mid. and southern Atlantic, Allied ships and aircraft in distress, and Argentine Navy and enemy covert activities in South America and Africa</B>. <B><COLOR="Red">The covert communications were intercepted by a Coast Guard unit which was stationed at Recife with our Navy.</COLOR></B> I never did find out what happened after we were able to locate a covert transmitter but did observe that they were not heard shortly thereafter. <B>The German submarines were not difficult to identify since they usually sent a message called a "B-barred," which began with "dahh dit dit dit dahhh."</B> This sound made the cold chills run-I can still hear it occasionally. <B>The DF equipment (DAB) was a far cry from that of today. It was about 15 feet long, mounted on a pivot with antennas at each end. The operator manually twisted the machine back and forth as many times as be could during the 20 or so seconds that a suspected enemy submarine transmitted. getting as many crosses as he could on the scope in order to estimate the direction. </B>One had to be in fairly good physical condition to be able to twist the equipment back and forth rapidly enough to get a bearing. The DAB at Bahia had a practice of twisting off at the bottom of the pedestal. which was another reason one had tobe in fairly good physical condition. Communications were not very rapid in those days. Our only electrical communications were by manual Morse. We communicated by Morse within the OF net for tip-off and reporting. Recife communicated with Washington for administrative and operational traffic and acted as rday point between. Washington and Ascension Island. Once when I was operating the Recife Washington circuit and could not raise Washington to receive high precedence traffic, Navy control at Guam came up on my.frequency, received my messages and relayed them to Washington. (I do not think HF wave propagation predictions would have come up with that one.) <COLOR="Red"><B>Operating communications circuits was less demanding than operating an intercept position</B>-you could always ask for a repeat if something were missed when communicating.</COLOR> Also, when communicating. you could ask the operator at the other end to slow down, to improve sending or, in a dire situation, to put another operator on the set. In contrast to today's highly formatted procedures for intercepting manual Morse-with----------------- ------------------------ our main objective was to copy every dit and dah that the target sent. The format was incidental. In fact, we objected even when told that the date should be typed on the upper right hand corner of the page. A lot more is expected of today's intercept operators: now the operator is expected to copy the target, do running traffic analysis and then tag everything for computer processing. The receivers we used were rather simple in design. One did not have to turn the BFO to change the pitch of a signal; you could just put your hand on the chasis. If someone walked too close to your receiver, the pitch changed. Simplicity in the design of the receivers was a blessing in disguise because of the severe lack of spare parts. An essential part of maintenance training was learning how to repair a burned-out tube with a shot of high voltage. It worked, sometimes. <B>For DF tip-off and reporting we used a tracking code</B>, <B><COLOR="Red">for administrative and operational traffic, one-time pads.</COLOR></B> Pencils with erasers were an important part of the inventory: we used them to push the paper strips back and forth on the board when enciphering traffic. This slow, tedious method of encipherrnent had its drawbacks but, in retrospect, it served as a great managerial tool in keeping electrical communications to a minimum. One cannot but wonder what the reduction in our current electrical communications would be if the only available encipherment systems used manually manipulated paper , key strips. <B>The German Navy operators sounded like machines. Towards the end of the war, however, there was a noticeable deterioration in the quality of their communications.</B> On the other end of the spectrum, the Italians and Argentinians competed for qualifying as the poorest communicators. There were five of us that first went to Salinas de Margarita to build the station, with others arriving later to make a total crew of 21 Americans: 1 Officer in Charge, 2 machinist mates, 1 medic, 2 cooks, 1 Chief, 2 First Class. and 12 Radiomen. It seems that the Officer in Charge was selected because he could speak Portugese rather than for his managerial abilities. We hired laborers and skilled craftsmen from the local population of about 700 people. Until the barracks, power station and galley had been built, we lived on a small cabin cruiser that had brought us from Bahia. Captain Harper, USN, was the Captain of our boat for a while. The villagers had no electricity and no method of refrigeration. The natives were quite interested in our electric lights but did not like the sensation of cold produced by ice cubes. In this area the temperature, even in the wintertime, never went below 55-60 degrees and since these people had never experienced the feeling of cold, handling an ice cube, even briefly, caused them acute pain. Our buildings at Salinas had no provision for heat and the only hot water was in the galley. The people of Salinas appeared to be gentle and to be happy with their lot. Their main occupations were fishing, pearl diving and working on salt beds. The religion was a mixture of Voodooism and Catholicism. It was customary to see a person in pagan dress on a Catholic holy day. There were no native doctors or dentists on Salinas. We did have a medic on the station but some natives refused treatment through fear. Malaria was as common as a cold in America. Some-of the natives were very skilled craftsmen in woodworking although their tools were quite primitive. Logistics was a major problem at Salinas. I can recall that the only meat we had for three weeks was turkey. Even the ingenuity of an excellent Italian-American cook cannot make turkey tolerable three times a day for three weeks. Broadway Rhythm with Lena Horne was our only movie for a seven-week period. You would be amazed at the improvisations that take place under these conditions. Did you ever see an entire movie backwards? By the end of the seven weeks, all the parts had been memorized by the sailors, including Lena Horne's, and one innovation was to turn the volume down and have the sailors take the speaking and singing parts. Because of the lack of spare partS, the three vehicles (a weapons carrier, a jeep and a motor scooter), were often inoperative. Partly due to inoperative vehicles and partly due to the lack of recreation, horses became a part of the station complement. Most of the sailors, at one time or another, owned a horse, except for a seaman guard who had a donkey. I bought a beautiful quarter horse and a very ornate saddle for the total price of $75.00. Horse racing and rides through the jungle became enjoyable pastimes. When I had to go to the transmitter shack to change frequencies, it was usually by horseback. If the fuel shortage continues, this kind of experience in travelling may prove useful. ....................was sent to Bahia in 1948 to help the Brazilian Navy take over the station. The transfer to the Brazilians was accomplished in 1949 and the entire net turned over to them by 1950. Mr. Horn retired recently from NSA after spend. ing most of his career io collection activities.

<B><SIZE="3">Destroyer Escort Historical Museum USS Slater DE766 Albany New York</SIZE></B> <B>Destroyer Escort Weapons and Technology</B> Destroyer escorts mounted the latest and most up-to-date anti-submarine weapons and detection gear <COLOR="Red">available during World War II, including depth charges, hedgehogs, air and surface search radar, sonar, <B>and a high frequency radio direction finder known as HF/DF</B></COLOR>. Destroyer escorts also carried a sophisticated control station for this technology known as the combat information center. The ships mounted hedgehog ahead-thrown depth charges and conventional depth charges for attacking submerged boats, as well as large and small caliber deck guns. All of these technologies are preserved intact aboard the SLATER today. Radar transmitted microwave beams in a straight line through the air. When these beams struck an object, reflected energy returned to and was captured by the radar antennas. The effective range of search radars was extended by placing the surface and air antennas high on top of the ship's mast. Targets could be detected by radar long before visual sightings were made. This reflected information was displayed on radar scopes as the contact's bearing and range. Radarmen plotted this information and, with a series of plots over time, could determine the contact's course and speed. Radar was one of the most important innovations of World War II. Sets mounted onboard ships early in World War II could barely detect a large ship and had very little chance of finding the small conning tower of a submarine. However, radar technology evolved rapidly during the war and improved sets were installed on ships frequently. By the time the SLATER was commissioned in 1944, its radar sets could detect airplanes almost ninety miles away and a U-boat's periscope at two miles away. The radar sets currently mounted onboard the ship, an SA air search set and SL surface search set, are the same types carried by the SLATER during World War II.1 Sonar was a destroyer escort's only means of detecting a submerged submarine. A sound wave was transmitted through the water. An object in the water caused an echo to return. The operator used the time the echo took to return to estimate the distance to a potential target. Sonar technology improved dramatically during the course of World War II, but it was still markedly inferior to sonar equipment in use today. The sonar set carried onboard the USS SLATER, designated QGB, was similar to a searchlight beam in that it scanned only a small area at one time, and that it had to be constantly shifted manually to scan the whole area ahead of a ship.2 Upon the SLATER's return from Greece, the sonar room had been gutted and a postwar SQS-4 sonar stack was in place in the lower sound room. This sonar set has been restored to working condition by SLATER volunteers. In addition, a World War II QGB set from the USS LOESER DE680, identical to that carried by the SLATER, was donated to the museum in 2006. This set was installed in its original location in the SLATER's upper sound room on the flying bridge. Other sonar equipment, including a bulkhead mounted attack plotter and tactical range recorder, are installed in their original positions in the sound room. <B>One of the most important technological developments of World War II resulted in the HF/DF detection gear. HF/DF stood for high frequency direction finder, but was most commonly known as Huff Duff. This detection gear was installed on Allied escort ships and found at land based listening stations during WWII. Huff Duff was developed to intercept Nazi U-boat transmissions.</B> Nazi strategy called for U-boats to keep in constant radio contact with U-boat headquarters in France. They radioed convoy contact and weather reports and received their operating instructions. By intercepting these transmissions, the Allies were able to determine the direction, or line of position of the U-boat relative to the receiving ship or land installation.<B> If two or more allied ships or land facilities in different locations intercepted the same transmission, it was possible to triangulate the U-boat's position.</B> Convoys could thus be rerouted to avoid the submarines. Allied hunter killer groups, many of them including destroyer escorts, could then locate and attack the U-boat wolf packs. (A wolf pack refers to a group of German subs traveling and operating together, thus increasing their ability to cause damage to a convoy). HF/DF intercepts were responsible for nearly one quarter of all U-boat losses during World War II. The actual Huff Duff equipment consisted of a tall radio antenna carried aft of the stack. The radio receiver and scope were located at the operator's station in a compartment in the aft deckhouse on destroyer escorts. <COLOR="red">Although the SLATER itself never carried a HF/DF set,<B> the equipment currently on display in the ship is the last Huff Duff set known to exist. Given the significance of HF/DF to the Allied victory in World War II, the set is displayed onboard the SLATER in the location that it would have been mounted on other destroyer escorts</B></COLOR>. 3 The efforts of the radar, sonar and HF/DF operators on destroyer escorts were coordinated by a station known as the Combat Information Center or CIC. This was an area abaft the bridge and under the flying bridge that housed the radar equipment, plotting tables, internal and external communications gear, and various other status and plotting boards. CIC received, evaluated and plotted on a universal drafting machine all information from sonar, radar, bridge, lookouts, radio, semaphore flags or signal lights, and anything else pertinent. It then fed data and recommendations to the captain on the flying bridge to assist him in his decisions. In addition to tracking air and sea contacts and reporting their course and speed, CIC also assisted in station keeping, fire control, shore bombardment, navigation and search and rescue. The CIC was the nerve center and eyes of the ship whenever the ship was underway by night, day, fog, rain, snow or clear skies. The value of the Combat Information Center in the destruction of enemy submarines was considerable. Once a destroyer escort detected a submarine, it could attack with hedgehogs and depth charges. The hedgehog projector was designed to fire twenty-four projectiles at a submarine ahead of a destroyer escort while the ship still had sonar contact with the target. World War II sonar scanned only ahead, so contact was always lost when an attacking ship got over the submarine in order to drop depth charges. The hedgehog projector solved this problem. Hedgehog projectiles were loaded on a launcher consisting of cylindrical bars called spigots, attached to cradles, which swung about a fore and aft axis by means of a roll correction gear assembly mounted on a gun train indicator pedestal. The movement was limited, but it allowed the spigots to train enough to compensate for roll of the ship and to aid in leading the target. The spigots are so positioned that, when fired, the charges described an elliptical pattern of about 140 by 120 feet. Hedgehog projectiles carried a contact fuze, meaning a direct hit on the submarine was required. Nevertheless, even the small charge carried in the projectile head was lethal.4 Destroyers also carried large number of depth charges to counter submarines. There were two depth charge racks on the stern and four depth charge projectors on each side of the ship to fire depth charges outward. The depth charge, with its 300 to 600 pounds of TNT, was the traditional antisubmarine weapon. However, a depth charge barrage required a high degree of accuracy, particularly against double-hulled German U-boats. The "water hammer" effect of a 300 pound depth charge required an explosion within thirty yards of the submarine hull for damage and ten yards for a kill. The 600 pound depth charge's lethal area was considerably enlarged. During the war, the Navy introduced a new type of charge with a "teardrop" shape and tail fins, like aerial bombs, to make them sink faster. Depth charges were detonated by hydrostatic pressure, with depth set before firing. Later models also had magnetic impulse detonators which would fire when in proximity to a submarine. Japanese submarines, lacking the hull strength and depth tolerance of their German counterparts, were more vulnerable to destruction by this weapon. 5 Finally, destroyer escorts carried many guns. As noted above, destroyer escorts carried either 3"/50 main guns or 5"/38 guns. The USS SLATER, being a CANNON class, mounted three 3"/50 guns. The 3"/50 caliber dual purpose guns were mounted inside circular gun shields. The later destroyer escort classes had two 5"/38 caliber dual purpose destroyer type guns in enclosed movable gun mounts. Both types could be fired individually or by director fire control. The 3" guns were frequently criticized as lacking in penetration power against double-hulled U-boats. The 5" type was far more effective. In addition to the above weapons, a destroyer escort had a secondary battery of about eight 20mm machine guns and one quadruple 1.1" or one twin 40mm machine gun. Although designed primarily for anti-aircraft defense, these guns were quite often effective antipersonnel weapons. They could quickly sweep an enemy gun crew off the deck of a submarine or keep men pinned down inside the conning tower of a damaged submarine on the surface. The advent of kamikazes in the Pacific induced a hurried and massive addition of 40mm, 20mm, 50 caliber and even 30 caliber machine guns. The SLATER represents this late war modification. It mounts three twin 40mm gun mounts and nine twin 20mm machine gun mounts.6 <B>Destroyer Escorts in the Atlantic</B> The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest battle of World War II. It began immediately upon the British declaration of war against Germany in September 1939 and ended with Germany's surrender to the Allies in May 1945. During those six years, thousands of ships were sunk and tens of thousands of men were killed in the Atlantic Ocean. The battle pitted Allied merchant and supply ships, along with their escorts, against German submarines, aircraft, and surface raiders. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said of the Battle of the Atlantic, "everything elsewhere on land, sea and air, depended ultimately on the outcome of this battle." The outcome of the Battle of the Atlantic depended on the destroyer escort. The outbreak of World War II caught both the British and German navies by surprise. Germany had less than fifty U-boats available in 1939, but the British had few escorts with which to counter them. The Nazis immediately began a program of unrestricted submarine warfare against British shipping, a strategy that came very near to starving England out of World War II. Although the British Navy began convoying ships as soon as the war started, its lack of escorts cost these convoys dearly. As more and more German submarines entered the battle, British shipping losses increased at an alarming rate. Churchill appealed to President Franklin Roosevelt for aid. Although the United States was neutral, Roosevelt agreed to provide the British Navy with fifty obsolete four piper destroyers in exchange for the use of British bases in the Caribbean. The United States also began neutrality patrols, ostensibly to protect neutral shipping rights in the western Atlantic but also to give American naval commanders vital experience should the United States enter the war. The United States also agreed to build escort vessels for the British under the Lend Lease Program. It was this program, combined with America's experimentation with the World War I Eagle Boats, which ultimately led to the development of the destroyer escort. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 brought the United States openly into the war. Germany's declaration of war against the United States also greatly expanded the Battle of the Atlantic. German submarines, which had been operating out of western France since its capitulation in June 1940, had the range to reach the East Coast as well as the Gulf of Mexico. America's sudden entry into the war left it completely unprepared to face the U-boat menace. In the first months of 1942 alone, German submarines sank hundreds of Allied ships, mostly along the eastern United States. The United States Navy soon adopted the British convoy system, but it lacked enough ships to escort the hundreds of ships sailing across the Atlantic to supply England. By this time, the Navy had approved the destroyer escort design, but it would be nearly a year before the first destroyer escort joined the fleet. American industry was still transitioning from a peacetime to a wartime footing, so there not enough war materials necessary to build all of the warships and landing craft needed to fight a war in two oceans. Until the destroyer escorts were available in force, the US Navy was forced to rely on stopgap escort vessels, including the four pipers and sub chasers. Despite the mammoth efforts of these inadequate ships, 1942 proved to be the worst year of the war for the Allies in terms of ships lost in the Atlantic. Between January and December 1942, German U-boats and aircraft sank over 1,000 Allied ships both in the Atlantic and off the East Coast of the United States. 1 Finally, in January 1943, the first destroyer escorts entered the Battle of the Atlantic. American industrial capacity had caught up with demand and would soon exceed all expectations. By the end of the year, sixteen American shipyards were launching seventeen destroyer escorts per month. These new ships immediately began the dangerous task of escorting Allied merchant ships across the U-boat infested Atlantic.<B> Destroyer escorts became even more deadly adversaries to the U-boats as improved electronic equipment, such as radar and HF/DF, became available. In addition, the construction of small escort carriers allowed the Navy to form hunter killer groups. These groups, consisting of one escort carrier supported by several destroyer escorts, were not tethered to a convoy, but could roam the Atlantic ferreting out U-boats and destroying them</B>. The tide of the Battle of the Atlantic turned irrevocably against the Nazis in May 1943. That was the first month that more U-boats were sunk than Allied merchant vessels. From May 1943 until the end of the war two years later, German submarines were unable to duplicate their successes of the first three years of the war. Destroyer escorts were an instrumental part of the Allied victory in the Atlantic. Their range and seaworthiness allowed them to escort convoys back and forth across the Atlantic despite fierce North Atlantic storms. Their radar, sonar and HF/DF equipment allowed them to detect U-boats, surfaced or submerged, by day or by night and in any weather conditions. Their speed, maneuverability and firepower made them lethal foes once a U-boat had been found. Finally, their overwhelming numbers due to their rapid construction made it virtually impossible for the submarines to hide.2 Destroyer escorts also carried out several important feats during the Battle of the Atlantic. Perhaps the most important of these feats was the capture of the German submarine U-505.3 The submarine was captured on 4 June 1944 by a hunter killer group composed of the escort carrier USS GUADALCANAL CVE60 and the destroyer escorts USS PILLSBURY DE133, USS POPE DE134, USS FLAHERTY DE135, USS CHATELAIN DE149, and USS JENKS DE665. The destroyer escorts attacked the submerged U-boat and forced her to surface. Boarding parties from the destroyer escorts then rushed over to the submarine while its crew abandoned ship. The American sailors stopped the submarine from sinking and then towed it back to Bermuda. The capture of the U-505 was one of the greatest intelligence coups of World War II. It gave the Allies a working Enigma code machine; a device which generated codes that the Allies had been only marginally successful at cracking. It also produced a complete set of the code books to go along with the machine. Most importantly, the U-505 gave the Allies the current settings for the Enigma machine in use by the U-boat fleet, which allowed the Allies to begin cracking German codes with great success. These finds allowed Allied cryptographers to intercept, decode and read German radio transmissions almost as quickly as the Germans themselves. The U-505 was an intelligence bonanza in other ways as well. It gave the Allies an opportunity to test the capabilities of their German foes, which in turn led to improved tactics to counter the U-boats.4 The USS SLATER also had a small part to play in the U-505 incident. Among the many discoveries on the submarine was a new type of acoustic torpedo. These deadly weapons locked onto the propeller noise of Allied ships and caused massive damage when they struck. The acoustic torpedo was taken from the U-505 and loaded onto the SLATER, which was in Bermuda at the time completing training exercises. The SLATER rushed the torpedo back to the United States for analysis, which resulted in an improved countermeasure to the acoustic torpedo known as the Foxer gear. This improved countermeasure saved many lives in the war's remaining months. The U-505 and the torpedo delivered by the SLATER are currently on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois. Germany's surrender in May 1945 ended the longest continuous battle of the war. Between 1939 and 1945, more than 2,700 Allied merchant ships were lost to enemy activity, with over 1,000 being lost to German U-boats alone. Over 130,000 Allied sailors lost their lives in the battle. Although these losses were severe, they would have been much worse without destroyer escorts. Once these ships entered the battle in 1943, U-boat successes dropped dramatically. By the time the SLATER joined the battle in 1944, convoy losses to U-boats had been almost eliminated. The SLATER escorted 176 merchant ships across the Atlantic without loss during World War II.5 As severe as the Allied losses were, they were much worse for the U-boat force. Of 1,100 German submarines produced during the war, nearly 800 were lost to Allied action. 28,000 of 40,000 U-boat sailors were killed in the Battle of Atlantic. Statistically, the job of a German submarine sailor was the deadliest of the entire war. Destroyer escorts were responsible for many of these U-boat losses. They were instrumental to the Allied success in Europe during World War II.6 .................................(article continues) 1 Davis, Destroyer Escorts of World War II, 5; Elliot, Allied Escort Ships, 523-4. 2 For an in-depth evaluation of World War II sonar technology, see Hackmann, Willem, Seek and Strike: Sonar, Anti-Submarine Warfare and the Royal Navy, 1914-1954, London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1984. 3 Andrews, Tempest, 2, 20; Elliot, Allied Escort Ships, 525-6. 4 Elliot, Allied Escort Ships, 530-1; Campbell, John, Naval Weapons of World War II, Annapolis: United States Naval Institute Press, 1985, 91-2. 5 Ibid., 88-90; Friedman, Norman, US Naval Weapons, London: Conway Maritime Press, 1983, 122-24. 6 Roscoe, Destroyer Operations, 15-18; Friedman, Naval Weapons, 64-7, 72-3, 76-81.

Here are the WWII recollections of a former member of the Branch to which I later belonged - Tel(S) <CENTER>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</CENTER> My personal history in the Royal Navy I was called up into His Majesty's Royal Navy on 8th March 1943 and reported to HMS Royal Arthur (Butlins Holiday Camp) Skegness for kitting out and basic training which lasted seven weeks, then it was up to Dundee for 18 weeks to train as a Telegraphist (Wireless Operator) after which it was over to the West Coast of Scotland at Ayr another Butlins camp HMS Scotia where a further 10 weeks were spent, final exams were taken and I passed out as an Ordinary Telegraphist. The next port of call was to my Naval depot HMS Drake at Plymouth and after a short stay <B>was sent to Eastbourne for a period of 3 weeks to train as a High Frequency Direction Finding operator (HF/DF) more universally known in the Navy as Huff Duff.</B> Again I passed out and was promoted to Telegraphist Special Operator (Tel(s)) it was now the second week of December 1943 Back again to HMS Drake to await a draft to a ship, and early in the new year of 1944 I along with two colleagues who had trained with me took the long journey from Plymouth to Belfast where we reported to the base ship HMS Caroline a First World War Cruiser to await the arrival of HMS Cooke a Captain Class Frigate, part of the 3rd Escort Group. The 3rd Escort Group based at Belfast spent many patrols in the Atlantic in support of Convoys, then when D Day came the Group were involved in the English Channel where on the 9th Day after D Day we lost HMS Blackwood 20 miles NNE of Cap de la Hague torpedoed by U-764. We worked in the English Channel up to early September, then it was a three week trip across the Atlantic and back escorting convoys, after which it was a Russian Convoy and on the return journey we had to return to Russia with a fast convoy and did not get back to Belfast until 16th November 1944. Irish Sea patrols came next for a shortish period due to the U-Boats penetrating our Western seaboard. Our final travels took us once again into the English Channel where we patrolled until the war ended. It was back to HMS Drake after HMS Cooke paid off at Hull to await my next draft which was to Malta where I was shore based at a small interception wireless station And after twelve months on Malta I finally was sent home for demobilization. My final date of discharge from the Royal Navy was 21st September 1946 I wish to acknowledge the considerable amount of help I have received from fellow members of the Captain Class Frigate Association, with details of operations and their personal photographs many of which are shown on this web site, one person I must pick out for the really vast amount of information he has provided me with is the late Donald Collingwood who unfortunately Crossed the Bar early in August. I also wish to thank Gupmundur Helgason for allowing me to use up to date information as displayed on his web site Uboat.net which records all the U-boats sunk during World War II. Roy B.

The following selected excerpts are taken from J. Proc's <B>NAVAL RADIO OPERATIONS DURING WORLD WAR II</B> a site which provides quality information and to which I make frequently reference for many of my posts. In these excerpts there are explanations of D/F equipment in use, the Operators using same and the procedure for reporting intercepted transmissions. <CENTER>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</CENTER> <B><SIZE="3">DIRECTION FINDING</SIZE></B> Medium and low frequency radio signals have very long wavelengths so there is little hope of building efficient, highly directional shipboard DF antennas at these frequencies. However, at relatively short distances, even an small antenna will work because enough signal will be present for detection. Most warships of the inter-war period were fitted with direction finders whose antennas consisted of a pair of crossed loops. They were generally described as navigational in nature, but they could have been conceived as a means of detecting enemy transmitters just beyond the horizon.High frequency direction finding (HF/DF) is also known by the sobriquet Huff Duff and was a relatively new development at the outbreak of hostilities. Production was slow and experience in correct operating techniques had to be gained step by painful step. By the end of 1942, HF/DF was accepted as an essential part of the equipment that vessels had to carry. Later in the war, convoy rescue ships and some merchant ships were fitted with HF/DF sets. In retrospect, Huff Duff played an extremely important part in the Battle of the Atlantic along with ASDIC and Radar. From the beginning of World War II, a shore based Huff Duff organization was in existence. The network of stations in the British Isles gradually grew to include shore stations in Africa, Iceland, Greenland, Bermuda and North America. In Canada, there were stations located at Cap d'Espoir, Gaspe; Coverdale, New Brunswick; Harbour Grace, Gander Newfoundland, Fort Chimo, Quebec and Hartlen Point, Nova Scotia. There was also a very active station in Winter Harbour, Maine. Cross bearings could be taken by means of all these stations and fixes were plotted by special tracking centres. Escorts would then be alerted and the courses of convoys altered, if necessary. Alternately, aircraft or hunter- killer groups could be dispatched to the area of a Huff Duff fix. In the summer of 1942, three British HF/DF sets were given to the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for study and evaluation. By the fall of that year, sets were being installed in American ships because the Americans succeeded in developing an improved version of the British FH4 and called their set the DAQ.In Canada, in September of 1942, the Canadian Naval Staff approved in principle, the fitting of the HF/DF set Type FH3 in each Canadian destroyer of an escort group. However, the Canadian destroyer Restigouche had her Huff Duff set fitted earlier when she was undergoing repairs in Glasgow Scotland during the period December 1941 to March of 1942. The captain, Lt. Cdr. D.W. Piers, acting on his own initiative and against headquarters policy, convinced a British officer to fit the FH3 set. Fittings in other ships occurred during the winter or 1942/43 with the installation of the model FH4 Huff Duff. When FH4's were not available, FH3's were installed in their place. The problem of retrofitting a Huff Duff cabin into Canadian ships was solved in various ways. In the destroyer Restigouche, it was built on the upper deck amidships directly aft of the 3 inch gun platform while the HF/DF mast and antenna was fitted to the forward end of the after superstructure. On Tribal Class destroyers, the Huff Duff cabin was generally fitted under the lattice mast and over the crew's galley, however, on Huron and HAIDA the cabin was mounted aft. In Frigates, such as Montreal and Wentworth, the cabin was located under the port wing of the bridge and resembled a boy's square club house. Security was paramount but inconsistent in these fittings. Official photographs of the ships would have the sparsely ribbed, bird cage antenna censored from the top of the mast, whereas standard Supply Demands would have the shipment marked with the notation "for installation in the HF/DF cabin". Initially, each Huff Duff equipped ship was required to carry three additional Wireless Telegraphy (W/T) operators and Canadian ratings for the Huff Duff branch had to come from the fleet. ............................(article continues) Telegraphists drafted for the special Huff Duff course had to obtain a copy accuracy rate of 85% at eighteen words per minute in tests carried out by the Signal Training Centres. Special training consisted of a course in enemy W/T procedure, enemy W/T organization and a operations/maintenance course on the HF/DF equipment. A Leading Telegraphist Special Operator was distinguishable from a Leading Tel General Service by the absence of stars from the W/T badge, and having only a pair of wings divided by a lighting flash. Later in the war, as the size of the fleet increased, there was a proportional requirement for shore based operators. Wrens were enlisted to augment the shore staff. In the early part of the war, the limitations of the HF/DF system precluded accurate position finding of U-boats in the Atlantic. The gradual addition of more shore stations and the installation and improvement of Huff Duff eventually produced a system that was amazingly accurate. Naval Service Headquarters in Ottawa promptly received all U-boat bearings taken by the British. Ottawa was able to obtain fixes of enemy units in the area east of 30 degrees West with equal efficiency and in approximately the same time as was done in the Plotting Centre at the Admiralty. The positions obtained by Huff Duff were then broadcast to the escorts at sea. <COLOR="Red"><B>Occasionally, small problems arose. For example, during late 1943, the comparison of HF/DF bearing reports taken at sea with those of shore stations showed a constant reversal of sense (reciprocal bearing) when receiving U-boat transmissions on 4000 kc. Ships exhibiting this problem were HMS Hotspur, Dundee, Berry, and HMCS Ottawa. The discovery of this problem led to the requirement for frequent calibration of HF/DF equipment. When steaming close to shore, the D/F came in handy in fog or when the "old man" was off course.</B></COLOR> <B>HUFF DUFF CALIBRATION</B> From time to time, Huff Duff required calibration. This involved taking simultaneous visual and radio bearings of a distant transmitting station on relative bearings around the compass at intervals not exceeding 5 degrees. To accomplish this, a ship would generally be anchored in open water and simultaneous visual and radio observations would be made on a transmitting station. This station was located on a small auxiliary vessel chugging slowly around the ship. Conversely, the calibration could also be accomplished with the ship being swung relative to a fixed radio station. For HF/DF calibration, special auxiliary vessels were available on both the East and West coasts of Canada. Two of these were HMCS Seretha II at St. John's, Newfoundland and HMCS Merry Chase on the west coast. There were many different wireless exercises carried out during patrols. One such exercise took place with an aircraft. First, the aircraft was located using DF and the bearing was then passed on to the aircraft using W/T. Then the aircraft would home in on the ship. The usual routine was for the aircraft to transmit its call sign along with five second dashes on 375 kc. The ship would take the bearing. The bearing and the time was passed to the aircraft on 3925 kc. ..........................(article continues) <B>TRACKING DOWN U-BOATS</B> The greater need for special operators was in the Atlantic theatre. Here, an operator would listen on an assigned frequency made known by the Admiralty. These frequencies were listed in numbered sets called a Series. Two examples of these frequencies were 10525 and 12215 kc. The regular and constant relay of information on convoy position, course and speed back to German shore authorities on HF formed the basis of wolf pack operations. Once a member of the pack sighted the convoy, it was usually tasked as a 'contact keeper' until the pack was drawn in. This shadower made brief radio transmissions at regular intervals followed by a short MF homing beacon transmission. The MF homing beacon was the only direct communications permitted between the U-boats thus allowing the other members of the wolf pack to locate the convoy. As each U-boat gained contact with the convoy, it too made an HF report and continued to do so periodically until the battle was over. <COLOR="Red">On hearing a U-boat transmission, the intercepting operator would press a foot pedal which activated a microphone.<B> He would then shout a coded warning to other Huff Duff equipped ships to tune the intercepted frequency. After the other escorts and the convoy rescue ships obtained bearings, the results would be passed to the Senior Officer (SO) of the escort group and a fix was obtained. If it was a 15 to 20 mile ground wave bearing, the Senior Officer would send an escort chasing down the bearing.</B> The SO would also have a message transmitted notifying shore authorities of the U-boat's bearing or position. </COLOR> Ashore, operators would listen and search on Marconi CSR5 receivers. When a U-boat's transmission was picked up, the operator on watch would immediately warn another operator at a remote site where the actual work of taking another bearing would be performed. All Huff Duff operators knew how to recognize German transmissions and there was no dearth of signals. In the absence of HF/DF, the RCN also attempted to use the U-boat's own MF homing beacon which could be received on the commercial MF/DF set that was fitted on many Canadian ships. Unfortunately, the MF signal diffused rapidly and while it was sufficient to draw U-boats into the general area of a convoy, it was not sharp enough to permit an Escort to locate a small and elusive U-boat. The initial first sighting report by a U-boat invariably commenced with a recognizable symbol, namely, the B-Bar followed by four letter cypher groups. The following is an example of a first sighting report : BB CLC WOND ETHG ISYO VNOC etc. For transmitting homing signals, U-boats used different frequencies according to the time of day. Two popular frequencies were 384 and 437 kc. The signals were usually made at 15 and 45 minutes past each hour and would commence with a series of V's. Here is an example of a message: VVVV �� 632 1230 TTCA TNOC GNIT NIAM etc.. When German headquarters needed to communicate with U-boats, they repeated all broadcasts at one half to one hour intervals in case the transmissions were garbled. There was no need for the U- boat to signal receipt of a message. To the advantage of the Allies, the Germans's liberal use of radio made it possible for the British Admiralty in London to realistically make hour-to-hour tactical decisions then transmit those decisions to commanders at sea. This information could be used to prevent the assembly of a U- boat formation or in the worst case, reduce the number of U-boats to be dealt with when the attack finally came. .................................(article continues) <B>Order CCNO 526 defined how D/F reports from H.M.C. ships should be sent: </B> D/F reports of all signals, both H/F and M/F, believed to be transmitted by enemy units (particularly U-boats), are to be forwarded by all H.M.C. Ships and by H.M. Ships operating under orders of R.C.N., in duplicate, to Captain (D) of their base for information and for onward transmission to the Officer-in-Charge, Operational Intelligence Centre, Naval Service Headquarters. In the case of group operations one collated report for the group as a whole is to be rendered by the Senior Officer. These reports are to contain the following information:-- (a) Dates on which watches commenced and ceased. (b) Frequencies or series guarded on all receivers. (c) Details of all enemy unit transmissions intercepted as follows:-- (i) Date and time of intercept at end of transmission, G.M.T. (ii) Frequency in kilocycles. (iii) Ship's position. (iv) True bearing (and reciprocal when unsensed). (v) Class of bearing. (vi) "Ground wave", "Sky wave" or "Uncertain". (vii) Strength of signal. (viii) Remarks, to include as much of the preamble and text as could be read. 2. With regard to (c), (viii), above, it will not normally be possible to read the text of H/F messages from the unit transmission due to the over-riding importance of obtaining a bearing and sense. These details however, can usually be read from the Shore Station's acknowledgement. It should always be possible to read the text of U-boat M/F homing transmissions in addition to obtaining a bearing and sense, as the messages are repeated once or twice at each transmission. 3. In the case of operations by a group of ships the names of all ships fitted with H/F D/F should be included. Where duties comprise convoy escort the names of the rescue ship and any fitted merchant ships in the convoy should be given. 4. Remarks on enemy W/T procedure, particularly if they indicate changes in procedure, frequencies, etc., as compared with current publications and instructions, should be included. 5. Remarks on the tactical aspect of bearings of intercepted enemy transmissions should be included in the Report of Proceedings of the Senior Officer (in the case of convoy operations the Senior Officer of Escorts). In addition, order CCNO 560 defines the content of intercept reports sent by HMC Ships when copying enemy transmissions. An excerpt is provided here: Any H.M.C. ships may be ordered to report by signal, the interception and/or the bearing of any W/T transmission suspected of being of enemy origin. In such cases it is essential that the following information be included:-- (a) The frequency of the transmission. (b) The time (G.M.T.) at which the transmission was heard, i.e. the end of the first transmission, not the end of the repeat back by a shore W/T station. (c) If possible, the preamble and first or last two groups of the message. In the case of those messages prefixed "BB" or "WW", the first group and as much of the rest of the text as could be read, should be sent. NOTE.-- Any report made to shore authorities which includes a bearing or bearings, whether made as the result of a request from shore authorities or independently of such a request, must include the position of the intercepting ship or ships. ..................................(article continues throught to the end) <CENTER>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</CENTER>source <url>http://jproc.ca/rrp/nro_ww2.html</url> Little h
